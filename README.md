## About Me

Hi I'm Andrew. I'm new to coding and hopefully the knowledge and skills I pick up from this bootcamp will help lead into a career. 

### How I put this site together

For the HTML I started by inserting the basic format for HTML, such as DOCTYPE, HTML Language. For the body, header and nav were separated. For "section, article, h1-h3, and p", I listed all 4 under a unique ID "section ID = left", which made article under section, h1-h3 under article, and p under h1-h3, which hopefully covered the homerwork requirements for the HTML section.

For the CSS, aside from the requirements that were listed for the assignment, it was a whole bunch of tinkering with margin-top/right/bottom/left, padding top/right/bottom/left. I made use of the Google Chrome Inspection Tool, which allowed me to tweak the page without permanent changes.

Initially, I struggled with getting the layout of my page to sit according to the example, but after learning float and position in class, it helped me with positioning each section to where it needed to be, and then altering its padding and other specs to get it to look like the example. Later on, I also had a hard time getting the "aside box" to fit next to the "section" box, but after playing around with the padding-bottom, I was able to make it look like the example.
